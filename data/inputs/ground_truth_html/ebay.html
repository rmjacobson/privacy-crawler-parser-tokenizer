Â 

<p><strong>What is personal information?</strong></p>

<p>Personal Information is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>

<p>We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized or aggregated so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific natural person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.</p>

<p>We collect personal information from you when you use our Services.</p>

<div class="hide" aria-expanded="false">
<p>This section describes some additional important information related to your use of our Services. There are just a few more pieces of important privacy information related to your use of our Services that we need to cover:</p>

<h3>When you share your personal information on our sites or applications - what happens?</h3>

<p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the sellers and collections you follow, storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.</p>

<p>Your username is displayed throughout eBay and is available to the public. It is connected to all of your eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites refer to User IDs and specific items. So if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities.</p>

<p>To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.</p>

<h3>How you should use the information you receive on eBay</h3>

<p>When you are in a transaction with another user, we enable you to obtain or we may provide you with the personal information of the other user (such as his/her name, account ID, email address, contact details, shipping and billing address) to complete the transaction. We encourage you to inform the other user about your privacy practices and respect his/her privacy. In all cases, you must give the other user a chance to remove himself/herself from your database and give him/her a chance to review what information you have collected about them.</p>

<p>You may use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other services offered through eBay (such as escrow, shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<h3>Unwanted or threatening email</h3>

<p>We do not tolerate abuse of our Services. You do not have permission to add other users to your mailing list (email or postal), call, or send him/her text messages for commercial purposes, even if this user purchased something from you, unless the user has given his/her explicit consent. Sending unwanted or threatening email and text messages is against our <a href="/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>. To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails please forward the email to <a href="mailto:spam@ebay.com">spam@ebay.com</a> or <a href="mailto:spoof@ebay.com">spoof@ebay.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>Our websites are general audience websites, and our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users in this age group.</p>

<h3>Third Party Privacy Practices</h3>

<p>This Privacy Notice addresses only the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, or if you are directed to a third party website, their privacy notices and practices will apply.</p>

<p>We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites.</p>

For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the sellers and collections you follow, storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your username is displayed throughout eBay and is available to the public.

We encourage you to inform the other user about your privacy practices and respect his/her privacy. In all cases, you must give the other user a chance to remove himself/herself from your database and give him/her a chance to review what information you have collected about them.\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other services offered through eBay (such as escrow, shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our &lt;a href=\"/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259\"&gt;User Agreement\u003C/a&gt;.\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Unwanted or threatening email\u003C/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do not tolerate abuse of our Services.
