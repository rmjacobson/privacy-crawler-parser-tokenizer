                        collect debts, to analyze and enhance data (including data about users' interactions with our service), and to process and administer consumer surveys. In the course of providing such services, these Service Providers may
                        have access to your personal or other information. We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Partners:</strong> As described above, you may have a relationship with one or more of our Partners, in which case we may share certain information with them in order to coordinate with them on providing the Netflix service

                    <ul>
                        <li>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Promotional offers:</strong> We may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for your participation, will require us to share your information with third parties. In fulfilling these types of promotions, we may share

                    <p><strong>Protection of Netflix and others:</strong> Netflix and its Service Providers may disclose and otherwise use your personal and other information where we or they reasonably believe such disclosure is needed to (a) satisfy any

                        activities (including payment fraud), security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Netflix, its users or the public, as required or permitted by law.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transfer of assets, we will transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party
                        agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Statement.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whenever in the course of sharing information we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area and other regions with comprehensive data protection laws, we will ensure that the information is transferred
                in accordance with this Privacy Statement and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection.
            </p>
            <p>You may also choose to disclose your information in the following ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>certain portions of our service may contain a tool which gives you the option to share information by email, text message and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and applications on your smart device;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>social plugins and similar technologies allow you to share information.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Social plugins and social applications are operated by the social networks themselves, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies.
            </p>
            <h3>Access to Account and Profiles
            </h3>
            <p>For ease of access to your account, you can use the "Remember me on this device" function when you log in to the website. This function uses technology that enables us to provide direct account access and to help administer the Netflix
                service without requiring reentry of any password or other user identification when your browser revisits the service.
            </p>
            <p>To remove access to your Netflix account from your devices: (a) visit the "Account" section of our website, choose "Sign out of all devices," and follow the instructions to deactivate your devices (note, deactivation may
                not occur immediately) or (b) delete your Netflix settings from your device (steps vary by device and the option is not available on all devices). Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each
                visit. If you sell or return a computer or Netflix ready device, you should log out and deactivate the device before doing so. If you do not maintain the security of your password or device, or fail to log out or deactivate your device,
                subsequent users may be able to access your account, including your personal information.
            </p>
            <p>If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they will be able to see your information (including in some cases personal information) such as your watch history, ratings, and account information (including your email
                address or other information in the "Account" area of our website). This remains true even if you use our profiles feature.
            </p>
            <p>Profiles allow users to have a distinct, personalized Netflix experience, built around the movies and shows of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are available to everyone who uses your Netflix
                account, so that anyone with access to your Netflix account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles. You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not wish them to use or change your profile, be
                sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number or other information to the profile and will be provided with notice of collection and use at the time such information is requested
                (the Profile Privacy Notice applies (<a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/103458">https://help.netflix.com/support/103458</a>)).
            </p>
            <h3>Your Choices
            </h3>
            <p><strong>Email and Text Messages.</strong> If you no longer want to receive certain communications from us via email or text message, simply access the "Communications Settings" option in the "Account" section of our website
                and uncheck those items to unsubscribe. Alternatively, click the "unsubscribe" link in the email or reply STOP (or as otherwise instructed) to the text message. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from service-related correspondence
                from us, such as messages relating to your account transactions.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Push Notifications.</strong> You can choose to receive mobile push notifications from Netflix. On some device operating systems, you will be automatically enrolled in the notifications. If you subsequently decide you no longer wish
                to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device's settings functionality to turn them off.
            </p>
            <p><strong>WhatsApp.</strong> If you have enabled WhatsApp messages in connection with your Netflix account or profile and no longer wish to receive them, you can use your WhatsApp app settings to block them.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Interest-Based Ads.</strong> Interest-based ads are online ads that are tailored to your likely interests based on your use of various apps and websites across the Internet. If you are using a browser, then cookies and web beacons
                can be used to collect information to help determine your likely interests. If you are using a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device that includes a resettable device identifier, then that identifier can be used to help determine
                your likely interests. For your choices about interest-based ads from Netflix, please see the "Cookies and Internet Advertising" section (below).
            </p>
            <p><strong>Matched Identifier Communications.</strong> Some third party sites and apps allow us to reach our users with online promotions about our titles and services by sending a privacy protective identifier to the third party. A privacy protective
                identifier means we convert the original information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares the privacy protective identifier to identifiers
                in its database and there will be a match only if you have used the same identifier (such as an email address) with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send a given promotional communication
                to you on that third party site or app. You can opt out in the “Marketing Communications” section of the “Account” section of our website.
            </p>
            <h3>Your Information and Rights
            </h3>
            <p>You can request access to your personal information, or correct or update out-of-date or inaccurate personal information we hold about you.
            </p>
            <p>You can most easily do this by visiting the "Account" portion of our website, where you have the ability to access and update a broad range of information about your account, including your contact information, your Netflix payment
                information, and various related information about your account (such as the content you have viewed and rated). You must be signed in to access the "Account" section. You may also request that we delete personal information
                that we hold about you.
            </p>
            <p>To make requests, or if you have any other question regarding our privacy practices, please contact our Data Protection Officer/Privacy Office at <a href="mailto:privacy@netflix.com">privacy@netflix.com</a>. We respond to all requests we receive
                from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Please also see the "Your Choices" section of this Privacy Statement for additional choices regarding your
                information.
            </p>
            <p>We may reject requests that are unreasonable or not required by law, including those that would be extremely impractical, could require disproportionate technical effort, or could expose us to operational risks such as free trial fraud. We
                may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records purposes and to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. We take reasonable
                measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required.
            </p>
            <h3>Security
            </h3>
            <p>We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and modification. These measures are designed to provide a level of security
                appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information. Unfortunately, no measures can be guaranteed to provide 100% security. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
            </p>
            <h3>Other Websites, Platforms and Applications
            </h3>
            <p>The Netflix service may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as voice controls) operated by third party platforms, or contain links to sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of information may differ
                from ours. For example, you may be able to access the Netflix service through platforms such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes and a number of other Internet connected devices. These websites and platforms have
                separate and independent privacy or data policies, privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. In addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with the Netflix service.
            </p>
            <h3>Children
            </h3>
            <p>You must be 18 years of age or older to subscribe to the Netflix service. In certain jurisdictions, the age of majority may be older than 18, in which case, you must satisfy that age in order to become a member. While individuals under the
                age of 18 may utilize the service, they may do so only with the involvement, supervision, and approval of a parent or legal guardian.
            </p>
            <h3>Changes to This Privacy Statement
            </h3>
            <p>We will update this Privacy Statement from time to time in response to changing legal, regulatory or operational requirements. We will provide notice of any such changes (including when they will take effect) in accordance with law. Your continued
                use of the Netflix service after any such updates take effect will constitute acknowledgement and (as applicable) acceptance of those changes. If you do not wish to acknowledge or accept any updates to this Privacy Statement, you may cancel
                your use of the Netflix service. To see when this Privacy Statement was last updated, please see the "Last Updated" section below.

            <h3><span id="cookies">Cookies and Internet Advertising
</span></h3>
            <p>We and our Service Providers use cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons), as well as resettable device identifiers, for various reasons. For example, we use these technologies to make it easy to access our services by remembering
                you when you return, and to provide and analyze our services. We also use cookies, as well as resettable device identifiers, to learn more about our users and their likely interests, and to deliver and tailor marketing or advertising.
                We want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so this section explains the types of technologies we use, what they do and your choices regarding their use.

                    <p><strong>What are cookies?
<br /></strong><br />Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services. They are widely used to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information
                        and assist with service or advertising personalization.
                        <br /><br />Cookies are not the only types of technology that enable this functionality; we also use other, similar types of technologies. See below for more information and examples.

                    <p><strong>What are resettable device identifiers?</strong>
                        <br /><br />Resettable device identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the "Identifier for Advertisers" (or IDFA) on Apple
                        iOS devices and the "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant.

                            <p><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service. For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when
                                they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.

                            <p><strong>Performance and functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience with Netflix. For example, they help us to remember your preferences and
                                prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns,
                                click-through and other information) about our visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research. Deletion of these types of cookies may
                                result in limited functionality of our service.

                                to deliver ads that are more relevant to you. These types of ads are called "interest-based advertising." Many of the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.

                        <br /><br />To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with an resettable device identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually
                        found under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings). You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests.
                        <br /><br />Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:

                    <p><strong>How Does Netflix use Web Beacons and other Technologies?</strong>
                        <br /><br />Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies. We and our Service Providers may use them for similar purposes as cookies, such as to understand and enhance the use of our
                        service, improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and understand interactions with our marketing (including email and online ads on third party sites). Because web beacons often work in conjunction
                        with cookies, in many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.
                        <br /><br />We use other technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device.
                        We may use these and various other technologies for similar purposes as cookies, such as to enforce our terms, prevent fraud, and analyze the use of our service. There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding these technologies.
                        For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area; see your browser's help function or support area to learn more. Other technologies, such as Silverlight
                        storage, may be cleared from within the application.
