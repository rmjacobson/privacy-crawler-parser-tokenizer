			Our Commitment To Privacy
		</h2>

		<p>
			Data protection is of the utmost importance for the management of PhysicianAssistantForum.com. (“PAF”) The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, or e-mail address of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to PAF. By means of this data protection declaration, we would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.

			1. Definitions
		</h2>

		<p>
			The data protection declaration of PAF is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To accomplish this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.<br /><br />
			In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:
		</p>

		<h3 class="h3 h3--noLine">
			a) Personal data
		</h3>
		Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

		<h3 class="h3 h3--noLine">
			b) Data subject
		</h3>
		Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.

		<h3 class="h3 h3--noLine">
			c) Processing
		</h3>
		Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.

		<h3 class="h3 h3--noLine">
			d) Restriction of processing
		</h3>
		Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.

		<h3 class="h3 h3--noLine">
			e) Profiling
		</h3>
		Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location or movements.

		<h3 class="h3 h3--noLine">
			f) Pseudonymization
		</h3>
		Pseudonymization is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.

		<h3 class="h3 h3--noLine">
			g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing
		</h3>
		Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing is determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.

		<h3 class="h3 h3--noLine">
			h) Processor
		</h3>
		Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

		<h3 class="h3 h3--noLine">
			i) Recipient
		</h3>
		Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data is disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.

		<h3 class="h3 h3--noLine">
			j) Third party
		</h3>
		Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, is authorized to process personal data.

		<h3 class="h3 h3--noLine">
			k) Consent
		</h3>

		<p>
			Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.

			3. Cookies
		</h2>

		<p>
			PhysicianAssistantForum.com, uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.<br /><br />
			Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so- called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized, identified and authenticated using the unique cookie ID.<br /><br />
			Through the use of cookies, PAF can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the use of cookies.<br /><br />
			Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. A visitor that uses cookies does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed and website preferences are retained for visitor convenience. Our shopping cart and client systems also utilize cookies to ensure a seamless experience.<br /><br />
			The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Further, existing cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other appropriate software; a function that exists in all major Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website will be entirely usable.<br /><br />
			We've even explained what each of our cookies do for the sake of transparency. Which you can see here.

			4. Collection of general data and information
		</h2>

		<p>
			PAF collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system accesses the website. This general data and information is stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our systems and infrastructure.<br /><br />
			When using this general data and information, PAF does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our systems and infrastructure and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in the event of a cyber-attack. Therefore, PAF analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our organization, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data within relevant logs are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

			5. Registration on our website
		</h2>

		<p>
			The data subject has the ability to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data. What personal data is transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by the data subject is collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one or more processors or sub processors that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.<br /><br />
			By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address—assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject—date, and time of the registration is also stored. The storage of this data takes place in the background and is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate misuse of our systems and services. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to transmit the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.<br /><br />
			The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.<br /><br />
			The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal data is stored about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations. The entirety of the controller’s employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact persons.

			6. Subscription to our newsletters
		</h2>

		<p>
			Visitors and users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our online newsletters. The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data is transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller.<br /><br />
			PAF informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about product improvements and promotions. PAF’s newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject, for legal reasons, as part of a double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.<br /><br />
			During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.<br /><br />
			The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties, unless such transfer is necessary exclusively for the processing and delivery of the newsletter to the data subject. The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for delivery of the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller.

		<p>
			Our website contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our company, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject is automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller is stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties, unless necessary to deliver further correspondence.

		If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by PAF, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller. The employee of PAF will take the appropriate steps to restrict further processing.
		<h3 class="h3 h3--noLine">

			10. Legal basis for the processing
		</h2>

		<p>
			Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations is necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which is necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures such as inquiries concerning our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. The processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which is not covered by any of the aforementioned legal basis, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.

			11. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party

			Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and volunteer moderators.

			12. Period for which the personal data will be stored
		</h2>

		<p>
			The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.

			13. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data
		</h2>

		<p>
			It may sometimes be necessary to determine, under contractual obligation, the data subject provide us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obligated to provide us with personal data when our company enters into a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee shall clarify to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the execution of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the related consequences of not providing the personal data.
