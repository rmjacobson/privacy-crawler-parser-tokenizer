	                        <p><em>In June 2017, we announced that Yahoo and AOL had joined to become Oath, a digital and mobile media company and part of <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/privacy-policy-summary">Verizon</a>.  We’re now bringing Oath and Yahoo under a single privacy policy.  Some things haven’t changed, like the control tools we provide to help you manage your experience with us.  If you have an existing Yahoo or AOL account, you will need to agree to this Privacy Policy.  If you have not yet agreed to this Privacy Policy, the <a href="https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.htm?redirect=no">legacy Yahoo Privacy Policy</a> or <a href="http://privacy.aol.com/legacy">legacy Oath Privacy Policy (for AOL)</a> still apply to your account.  For Oath products or services that are accessed without signing into an account, this Privacy Policy applies to those products and services starting May 25, 2018.  If you are creating a new account, the terms below apply starting today.  </em></p>

<p><em>Last updated: April 2018</em></p>

<h4 style="color:Black;">Our Privacy Pledge</h4>

<p>Our commitment is to put users first.  We strive to be transparent about how we collect and use your information, to keep your information secure and to provide you meaningful choices.  This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information Oath, its <a href="./definitions/index.html">affiliates</a> and its house of global <a href="https://www.oath.com/our-brands/">brands</a> (“Oath,” “us,” “our” or “we”) collect, why we collect it and what we do with it. This policy applies to Oath <a href="https://www.oath.com/our-brands/">brands</a>, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (we’ll collectively refer to these as “Services”).  Additional privacy practices for certain Services can be found in <a href="#1"> Details for Specific Products and Services</a>.</p>

<h4 style="color:Black;">Your Controls</h4>

<p>We believe you should have tools to control your information. You can find controls to manage or review your account information, marketing preferences, location data, and search history at <a href="./controls/index.html">Privacy Controls</a>.  Some of our Services provide additional controls and privacy practices.  (<a href="#1">See, Details for Specific Products and Services</a>)<a id="2" name="2"></a></p>

<h4>How We Share This Information</h4>

<p>Oath shares information within its affiliated brands and companies and with Verizon.  We also share information we have about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to provide Services that you have requested (including when you connect with <a href="./topics/thirdparties/index.html">third-party apps and widgets</a>).  We do not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Oath unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>With Your Consent.  </strong>We will share information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Oath when we have your consent. </li>
	<li><strong>With Verizon.  </strong>As part of Verizon, Oath and its <a href="./definitions/index.html">affiliates</a> may, to the extent permitted by law and consistent with user controls, share information with Verizon and Verizon affiliates. This information will be used consistent with <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/privacy-policy-summary">Verizon’s privacy policy</a>.    </li>
	<li><strong>Within Oath.  </strong>Information may also be shared within Oath, including with other Oath Services and <a href="./definitions/index.html">affiliates</a>.  Oath affiliates may use the information in a manner consistent with their privacy policies.</li>
	<li><strong>With Partners.  </strong>We may share your information with nonaffiliated companies who are:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Trusted Partners.  </strong>We provide user information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Oath based on our directions and in compliance with appropriate confidentiality measures.  <a href="./topics/thirdparties/index.html">Learn more</a>. </li>
		<li><strong>Advertising, Analytics and Business Partners (Limited to Non-Personally Identifiable Information).  </strong>We may share aggregated or <a href="./definitions/index.html">pseudonymous</a> information (including demographic information) with partners, such as publishers, advertisers, measurement analytics, apps, or <a href="./topics/thirdparties/index.html">other companies</a>.  For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed or report how many people installed an app after seeing a promotion.  We do not share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address) with these partners, such as publishers, advertisers, measurement analytics, apps, or <a href="./topics/thirdparties/index.html">other companies</a>. <br />
		When you use third-party apps, websites or other products integrated with our Services, they may collect information about your activities subject to their own terms and privacy policies. <br />
		We allow <a href="./topics/thirdparties/index.html">other companies</a> that show advertisements on our webpages or apps to collect information from your browsers or devices.  Other companies' use of cookies and other data collection technologies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.  Like many companies, we may allow cookie matching with select partners.  But, these parties are not authorized to access Oath cookies.  </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>For Legal and Other Purposes. </strong> We may access, preserve and disclose information to investigate, prevent, or take action in connection with: (i) legal process and legal requests; (ii) enforcement of the <a href="./../terms/otos/index.html">Terms</a>; (iii) claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties; (iv) requests for customer service; (v) technical issues; (vi) protecting the rights, property or personal safety of Oath, its users or the public; (vii) establishing or exercising our legal rights or defending against legal claims; or (viii) as otherwise required by law.
	<ul>
		<li>This may include responding to lawful governmental requests.  Learn more about how we <a href="https://transparency.yahoo.com/principles">evaluate and respond to these requests</a>. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>New Ownership.</strong>  If the ownership or control of all or part of Verizon, Oath or a specific Services changes as a result of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, we may transfer your information to the new owner. </li>
</ul>
