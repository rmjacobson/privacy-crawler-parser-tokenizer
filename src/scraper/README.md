# scraper/ 
* sraper.py gets all text with default bs4 get_text()
* simple_parser.py separates html files into text via p tags, headers, lists, and is where all the current parsing efforts are.
* structural_parser.py is an older effort at the tag parsing and will probably be deleted or replaced eventually.
* segementer is just a very old file that hasn't been touched in a while

# scraper/divtest/
Leftover testing files from when divs were still fair game for parsing.  This has been since abandoned, but another look may be taken later.
